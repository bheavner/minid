# add methods to get other metadata from minids

# why have metadata slot instead of slots for metadata elements?

# if my package is called minid (and thus described in minid.R), and my
# constructor is named minid, how do I document the constructor? - the string
# "mind" is overloaded, even if I split out minid-package.r:

# > ?minid
# Using development documentation for minid
# Error in f(...) : rdFile must be a single element character vector.
# > ?minid()
# Using development documentation for minid
# Error in f(...) : rdFile must be a single element character vector.
